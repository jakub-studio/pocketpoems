# PocketPoems

App (PWA) made to showcase some of Sue Dymoke's poetry.

Codebase messy, kinda like spaghetti, but I did this with time restraints so I haven't had the time to format all the code and apply prettier and all that baloney.

note:

`/repo` is just the folder for the master branch (which is the public github pages site)
